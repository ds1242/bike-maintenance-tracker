 # David Shaw's Bike Maintenance Tracker ![badmath](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

  ## About/Description

  This is a web application using the MERN stack to track bike maintenance.  There are a lot of different parts on a bike that all require service at different times.  This application allows users to sign up, add their bikes, then track the current time and mileage of use to know generally when to service or replace those parts. 

  Future development plans including converting it to a PWA so end users can add it to their homescreen.
